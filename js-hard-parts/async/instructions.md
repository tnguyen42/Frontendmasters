Asynchronicity
==============

-   Note: We recommend that after you complete a challenge, you re-comment out the test case for that challenge so the console output is not confusing when working on subsequent challenges.
-   ### Challenge 1

    Thinking point (no writing code necessary for this challenge): Inspect the code given to you in Challenge 1. In what order should the console logs come out? `Howdy` first or `Partnah` first?
-   ### Challenge 2

    Create a function `delayedGreet` that console logs `welcome` after 3 seconds.
-   ### Challenge 3

    Create a function `helloGoodbye` that console logs `hello` right away, and `good bye` after 2 seconds.
-   ### Challenge 4

    Create a function `brokenRecord` that console logs `hi again` every second. Use the `End Code` button to stop the console logs when you are satisfied that it is working.
-   ### Challenge 5

    Create a function `limitedRepeat` that console logs `hi for now` every second, but only for 5 seconds. Research how to use `clearInterval` if you are not sure how to do this.
-   ### Challenge 6

    Write a function called `everyXsecsForYsecs` that will accept three arguments: a function `func`, a number `interval`, and another number `duration`. `everyXsecsForYsecs` will execute the given function every `interval` number of milliseconds, but then automatically stop after `duration` milliseconds. Then pass the below `sayHi` function into an invocation of `everyXsecsForYsecs` with 1000 interval time an 5000 duration time. What do you expect to happen?
-   ### Challenge 7

    Write a function `delayCounter` that accepts a number (called 'target') as the first argument and a number of milliseconds (called 'wait') as the second argument, and returns a function. When the returned function is invoked, it should log to the console all of the numbers between 1 and the target number, spaced apart by 'wait' milliseconds.
